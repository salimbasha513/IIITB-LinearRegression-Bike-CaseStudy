## General Information
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, experienced significant revenue declines during the COVID-19 pandemic. To recover and strategically plan for post-pandemic operations, the company seeks to understand the factors influencing bike-sharing demand. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset encompassing daily bike rentals, weather conditions, and user behavior patterns, this project aims to:

- Identify significant variables affecting bike demand.
- Develop a predictive model to forecast future demand.

## Conclusions
1. The rental count is likely to increase with an increase in temperature. So they should start marketing heavily 
in regions that are higher in temperature and humidity

2. Rental count is likely to decrease in regions with light rain/snow weather patterns. Hence the company should 
not invest heavily in such regions as it will be an insignificant investment.

3. Fall season encounters a heavy rise in rental count. Hence the company should focus on regions with heavy rainfall
and specially during months October.

4. On the other hand, rental count is likely to decrease during Spring season. So company can offer
discounts or other offers that may enhance the numbers during Spring.

5. Rental count is likely to high with every passing year. Hence company must plan accordingly in advance on supply of
bikes per region.
